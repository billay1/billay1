### Hi! Coucou! Akwaba! 👋

I am Yeyi Billa. Although I am tech person, I love literature so much, and you will often see me with a novel in hands.
I like this balance of technology and literature and invite you to discover my universe!


I am also very interested in robotics, and made a Tableau analysis on it in my Tableau portfolio: public.tableau.com/app/profile/yeyi  

Life is best when we enjoy our passions!
