### Hi! Coucou! Akwaba! ðŸ‘‹

I am Yeyi Billa. Although I am tech person, I love literature so much, and you will often see me with a novel in hands.
I like this balance of technology and litterature and invite you to discover my universe!

Let's connect on linkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeyi-billa/

I am also very interested in robotics, and made a Tableau analysis on it on my Tableau portfolio: public.tableau.com/app/profile/yeyi.billa  

Life is best when we enjoy our passions!
